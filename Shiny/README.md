Colon Cancer Classifier Models Using Exome Sequencing Data

This repository contains a comprehensive Shiny for Python web application deployed on Posit Connect Cloud for the classification of colon cancer using annotated exome sequencing data. The interactive platform enables researchers and clinicians to upload genomic variant datasets, perform automated preprocessing, train multiple machine learning models simultaneously, and conduct comparative performance analysis through an intuitive web interface.

üìÅ Input Data Format
The application accepts CSV files containing annotated exome sequencing data. Upload files should include genomic variant information with the following structure:
Required/Optional Columns:

Genomic coordinates: Chr (chromosome), Start, End
Functional annotations: Func.refGene (primary target variable), ExonicFunc.refGene
Pathogenicity scores: CADD, CADD_Phred, SIFT_pred, Polyphen2_HDIV_pred, Polyphen2_HVAR_pred
Prediction categories: MutationTaster_pred, MutationAssessor_pred, CLNSIG
Population frequencies: AF, AF_popmax

Automated Data Processing:

Missing value handling with intelligent imputation strategies
Categorical encoding using LabelEncoder for text-based annotations
Feature normalization with MinMaxScaler for numerical variables
Chromosome mapping converting chromosome identifiers to numeric values
Data validation and error handling for robust processing
